# My Personal Project: A White Day Love Story

## What will the application do?

*A White Day Love Story* is a short, decision-based game 
that will hopefully allow you to experience a simple love story between 
two university students on White Day. Pick the right choices to get the best ending!

(White Day is a holiday in Japan that occurs on March 14, that is similar 
to Valentine's Day. For many people, it is a second chance to profess
their love.)

## Who will use it?
Anyone who is looking to play a short game.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
I was inspired to create this game after hearing my friends complain about 
not being able to get a boyfriend. Even though their real love life is lacking,
maybe their digital one can be better!

Having played many otome games (Japanese dating sims), I decided to try my hand
at making something along that genre.

## User stories
