# My Personal Project: ChatAway

## What will the application do?

*ChatAway* is a short, decision-based game that will hopefully allow you to experience 
the possibilities of finding love online using a fictional chatroom service called ChatAway.  
Pick the right choices to get the best ending!

## Who will use it?
Anyone who is looking to play a short game.

## Why is this project of interest to you?
I was inspired to create this game after hearing my friends complain about 
not being able to get a boyfriend. Even though their real love life is lacking,
maybe their digital one can be better!

Having played many otome games (Japanese dating sims), I decided to try my hand
at making something along that genre.
